# 🧠 Deep Dive into Java OOP Concepts

This document provides an in-depth understanding of Java's Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) concepts, with advanced insights, examples, and best practices.

## 🔐 1. Encapsulation

**Definition**: Bundling data (fields) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) while restricting direct access to internal details.

### ✅ Key Concepts:
- Use **access modifiers** (`private`, `public`, etc.)
- Getters and setters control access to data.
- Promotes **data hiding** and **immutability**.

### 🔍 Advanced:
- Use encapsulation with validation logic.
- Java **records** (Java 14+) for immutable classes.

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0)
            balance += amount;
    }
}
```

## 📦 2. Abstraction

**Definition**: Hiding complex internal details and exposing only the necessary parts.

### ✅ Key Concepts:
- Achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.
- Focuses on **"what" an object does**, not **"how"**.

### 🔍 Advanced:
- Java 8+ interfaces support `default` and `static` methods.
- Abstract classes allow partial implementation.

```java
interface PaymentProcessor {
    void process(double amount);
}

class PayPalProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    public void process(double amount) {
        // PayPal-specific processing
    }
}
```

## 👪 3. Inheritance

**Definition**: A class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class.

### ✅ Key Concepts:
- `extends` keyword for class inheritance.
- `implements` for interface inheritance.
- Supports **code reuse**.

### 🔍 Advanced:
- Avoid deep inheritance trees.
- Prefer **composition over inheritance** where flexibility is needed.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

## 🧬 4. Polymorphism

**Definition**: Ability of an object to take on many forms.

### ✅ Key Concepts:
- **Compile-time**: Method Overloading
- **Runtime**: Method Overriding (dynamic dispatch)

### 🔍 Advanced:
- Enables **loose coupling** via interfaces.
- Useful in frameworks like **Spring**.

```java
class Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Shape");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}
```

## 🧱 Composition vs Inheritance

**Prefer composition** when behavior can be reused without tight coupling.

```java
class Engine {
    void start() {}
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine();
    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
    }
}
```

## 📐 SOLID Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| S - Single Responsibility | One class = One job |
| O - Open/Closed | Open for extension, closed for modification |
| L - Liskov Substitution | Derived classes should substitute base classes |
| I - Interface Segregation | Many small interfaces > one large interface |
| D - Dependency Inversion | Depend on abstractions, not concretions |

---

## 🔧 Object Class Best Practices

- Override:
  - `toString()` for meaningful object description.
  - `equals()` & `hashCode()` for correct behavior in collections.
